## Overview

Low-level system design involves understanding the core concepts of system architecture and designing scalable, maintainable, and efficient systems. This repository will try to cover solutions of various problems and scenarios using Go.

## Parking Lot System

The first project in this repository is a **Parking Lot System**. This system simulates a parking lot where vehicles can be parked and unparked. It demonstrates:

- Singleton design pattern for managing the parking lot instance.
- Handling different types of vehicles (e.g., cars, trucks).
- Parking space management across multiple floors.
- Payment processing for parked vehicles.

### Features

- Add and remove vehicles from the parking lot.
- Display the availability of parking spots.
- Calculate parking charges based on the duration of stay.
